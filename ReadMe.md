# Conference App: SpringBoot 

In this project, I followed the Pluralsight tutorial https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/creating-first-spring-boot-application/table-of-contents.

A basic API design was made with Spring boot. Through this API, CRUD operations were performed on the speaker and session resources.
